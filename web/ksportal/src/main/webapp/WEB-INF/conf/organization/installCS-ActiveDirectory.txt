Install CA Certificate

- Installed an Enterprise CA , with the distinguished name of cn=portal,dc=exoplatform,dc=org"

  By default the certificate file is named <dns name of ca>_<name of cert>.crt


- Copy <dns name of ca>_<name of cert>.crt (example : Win2k3vm.exoplatform.org_portal.crt) to java.home/jre/lib/security

- Goto java.home/jre/lib/security/

- Run: keytool -import -file <Win2k3vm.exoplatform.org_portal.crt> -keystore cacerts

- Enter password : changeit
