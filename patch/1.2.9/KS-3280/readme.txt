Tests to perform

Reproduction test

    * Create 4 sub-categories from one master category (cat1) , called A, B, C, D (in this order). Categories are displayed: A, B, C, D

Case 1:

   1. Move (using Drag&Drop) cat A between B and C. Categories are displayed: B, A, C, D
   2. Move (using Drag&Drop) cat B between A and C. Categories are displayed: B, A, C, D -> nothing changes
   3. Try (using Drag&Drop) to put cat A back before B. Categories are displayed: B, A, C, D -> nothing changes
   4. Move (using Drag&Drop) cat D between A and C. Categories are displayed: B, D, A, C ->D should be between A and C (and not before A)

Case2:

   1. Drag and drop A to the first place in the categories list which contains cat1 -> A in the second place

More generaly, moving a category is not easy, especially when you try to move first or last category or when you try to move a category near first or last one
