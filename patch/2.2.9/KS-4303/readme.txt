Go to Add Page â†’ Blank Page (or From Template)

Fix description
Problem analysis

For each created wiki, it has some privilege permission which is granted implicitly for administrators:
Super user
Admin groups
Portal creator groups
And when each page on that wiki is created will inherit all of its permission. But the problem is, it's still visible on wiki permission list but hidden in page permission list.
-> This is a conflict behavior
That's why when user try to add one of preceding administrators, it's filtered and not showed.
How is the problem fixed?

Show all permission involve normal and privilege entries in page permission list by removing:
HashMap<String, String[]> adminsACLMap = org.exoplatform.wiki.utils.Utils.getACLForAdmins();
// Filter out ACL for administrators
for(String id: adminsACLMap.keySet()){
permissionMap.remove(id);
}
Fix duplicated entry bug when adding to privilege permission group
if (!permissions.contains(portalEditClause)) {
     permissions.add(portalEditClause);
}
Prevent user from editing/removing that entries(make them immutable)
if (!uiPermissionEntry.isImmutable()) {
// Perform to edit or remove
}
