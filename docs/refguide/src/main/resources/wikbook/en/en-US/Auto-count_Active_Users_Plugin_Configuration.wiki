h1. Overview {anchor:id=KSref.UserStatistic.Overview}

The Auto-count Active Users component is to calculate the number of active users automatically. A user is considered as the active user only when he/she adds a topic/post in the Forum and his/her last post date matches the predefined interval time.

For example, if one user does not have any new posts after 15 days, he/she is not considered as an active user.

When the Job Scheduler runs, it will get values returned from the Auto-count Active Users plug-in component to identify the number of active users. This value is updated to Active Members information when the user views Forum statistics.
