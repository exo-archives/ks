h1. Overview

Forum and FAQ applications are to show some information about posters. 
The way we retrieve that information is pluggable through the ContactProvider component.

For public internet websites, users can provide personal information, such as personal email address and location. To enable, simply override the ContactProvider component in your configuration.

h1. Configuration

Configuration file format:

{code:xml}

    <key>org.exoplatform.forum.service.user.ContactProvider</key>
    <type>org.exoplatform.forum.service.user.PersonalProfileContactProvider</type>
 </component>

Finally, you can create your own implementation to apply custom privacy policies.
