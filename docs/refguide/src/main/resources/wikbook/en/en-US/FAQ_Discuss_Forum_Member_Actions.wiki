To discuss or view the discussion of a question, click on the discuss icon !DiscussIcon.png! at the top left of the question panel or click on a specific question and select *Discuss Forum* in menu:

After being discussed, a new topic is created into the forum which is defined as the discussed forum in the FAQ Setting and you are redirected directly to the Forum application:

When there is a answer added, a comment added or any edition in questions, the discussed topic in the Forum application is changed correspondingly.

However, when the question is clicked to discuss at the first time, its status is pending for approval. You can only view the discussed topic when the Forum Administrator/Moderator approve it.

After a question is discussed, to view it, simply clicking on the Discuss forum option in its right click menu.
