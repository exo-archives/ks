Since eXo KS 1.2, *FAQ* has been renamed to *Answers*

h1. Overview
FAQ and Answers are two portlets of the eXo Answers system. They are [Portal:WebUI] portlets runing on top of [eXo Portal|Portal:WebHome] and leverage the eXo Platform's technology such as [JCR|JCR:WebHome], [REST framework|WS:REST Framework] and [WS:Cometd].

Answers is a collaborative Question & Answer system similar to Yahoo Answers or StackOverflow.com but for your own enterprise where collaboration is encouraged. It poses a series of common questions and answers on a specific topic. There, users can edit questions, provide answers and edit them as they wish.

The Answers section familiarizes visitors with answers to most commonly asked questions about a site/service or about the entity/subject that is responsible for the site/service. Repeatedly received questions will be added into the Answers. 

FAQ takes this content as input and publish it in a clean and quickly browsable manner. You can point a FAQ portlet to one or several categories. As a publishing portlet, it is not possible to edit questions and answers from FAQ.
