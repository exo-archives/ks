h1. Bookmarkable Forum URLs Configuration



h1. Overview



This feature defines how the links are generated in the Forum application. You can choose to use ajax or not.

* By not using Ajax, the Forum will generate plain URLs in the links. The added benefit will be bookmarkability and better SEO as the links will be permalinks.
* Using ajax, the links will be javascript based and generate ajax calls. This should make browsing faster because the whole page is not reloaded. 

This article will explain how to configure the ajax setting for the forum portlet.






h1. Changing the portlet preference

The setting is called *useAjax* and  is defined in _portlet.xml_ file below:

{code}
<preference>
 <name>useAjax</name>
 <value>true</value> <!--true/false -->
 <read-only>false</read-only>
</preference>
{code}

By default, 'true' value is set. Because using Ajax will makes the speed of the Forum process fatser.

If you want to show the detail link to any forum/topic in the Forum Application, simply replace 'true' value by 'false', the Forum Application will be displayed with the detail link to the page that is being viewed.
