Otherwise, the Moderators also can open/close, lock/unlock, stick/un-stick, split/merge or approve/disapprove topics in a special Forum.

Normal users include guests and logged users. Guests have only the view permission while logged users can take some basic actions in the Forum application. By default, all users can view forum, all its topics and replies.

However, if the Administrator only set the view permission for some users or some groups to specific categories, forums or topics, only the users or the groups having the view permission can view them. When users have adding post permission, they can add their replies to the topics that they interest.
